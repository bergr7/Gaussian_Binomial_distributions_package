# gaubi_dists package

##Â Summary of the package

This is a python package that allows the user to calculate statistics (mean and
stdev) and plot pdf of Gaussian and Binomial distributions.

Addition of two different distributions is also included. However, note in the
case of binomial distributions these need to have the same probability.

## Files included in the package
